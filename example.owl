    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">King Diamond is a Danish heavy metal band formed in 1985 by vocalist King Diamond, guitarists Andy LaRocque and Michael Denner, bassist Timi Hansen and drummer Mikkey Dee. Diamond, Denner and Hansen had recently departed the group Mercyful Fate, and decided to form a new band under the King Diamond moniker, as it was already known from the Mercyful Fate days. In 1986, King Diamond released their debut album Fatal Portrait. Since then the band have released a total of twelve studio albums (most of them concept albums), two live albums, two extended plays, five compilations and five singles. Since the band's inception, there have been over fifteen musicians in and out of King Diamond, with the only two mainstays being vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Andy LaRocque. In 1987 the band released their second studio release Abigail (their first concept album). Throughout the 1980s, King Diamond released a total of four studio albums. In the early 1990s, the band was put on hold when King Diamond reunited with his former outfit Mercyful Fate. After reforming King Diamond in 1994, Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 90's. Since the early 2000s, King Diamond have kept recording and touring and, since 2014, the band has been composed of vocalist King Diamond, guitarist Andy LaRocque, guitarist Mike Wead, drummer Matt Thompson, and bassist Pontus Egberg.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">James Victor "Jimmy" Scott (July 17, 1925 – June 12, 2014), also known as "Little Jimmy Scott", was an American jazz vocalist famous for his high countertenor voice and his sensitivity on ballads and love songs. After success in the 1940s and 1950s, Scott's career faltered in the early 1960s. He slid into obscurity before launching a comeback in the 1990s. His unusual singing voice was due to Kallmann syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that limited his height to four feet eleven inches until the age of 37, when he grew eight inches. The syndrome prevented him from reaching puberty and left him with a high voice.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Shirley M. Gunter (September 29, 1934 – December 1, 2015) was an American singer and songwriter who led one of the earliest female doo-wop groups, Shirley Gunter and the Queens, in the mid-1950s. She was born in Coffeyville, Kansas; her younger brother was Cornell Gunter. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1942. Cornell Gunter was the first family member to join a vocal group, firstly being a founding member of The Platters and then, in 1953, joining The Flairs. He persuaded the Bihari brothers, owners of Flair Records, to audition his sister Shirley, and they signed her on the spot. After releasing solo singles without success, she formed a group, the Four Queens, with her friends Blondene Taylor and Lula Bee Kenney, and Lula's aunt Lula Mae Suggs. In 1954, Gunter and Taylor worked up a nonsense song, "Oop Shoop", and the group quickly recorded it with saxophonist and arranger Maxwell Davis. Credited to Shirley Gunter and the Queens, it immediately became a regional hit, and rose to number 8 on the national Billboard R&amp;B chart after being promoted by leading DJ Alan Freed. The song was also covered by the Crew-Cuts, whose version made number 13 on the national pop chart, and Harry James recorded a version in 1955 on his album Jukebox Jamboree (Columbia CL 615). "Oop Shoop" became the first record to be written and performed, with any degree of success, by a group of young black women", and inspired later groups such as the Cookies and the Shirelles. The Queens recorded several more singles for Flair, and toured widely. However, their records had little commercial success, and the group split up in late 1955. Gunter toured as a solo performer with Young Jessie and the Flairs, and featured on an early Modern Records compilation LP, The Hollywood Rock &amp; Roll Record Hop. She then became a member of the Flairs, and recorded a moderately successful single, "Headin' Home", with them. In 1958, Shirley Gunter – who had been registered as legally blind by 1954, and later lost her sight completely – left the music business to marry and raise a family. Her only later recordings came in 1965, when she recorded several tracks including the single "Stuck Up", for Ray Charles' Tangerine record label. Shirley Gunter later lived in Las Vegas, and continued to sing at her local church. In 1990, she made a rare appearance with Blondene Taylor, and the Flairs, at a Doo-Wop Society show. She died in Las Vegas in 2015, aged 81. In the 2000s, Ace Records released a CD compilation of her recordings, Oop Shoop: The Flair And Modern Recordings 1953-1957.</ns4:description>

Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the lead single, "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", the album was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker.

Beginning with "Searchin'" and "Young Blood", their most memorable songs were written by the songwriting and producing team of Leiber and Stoller. Although the Coasters originated outside of mainstream doo-wop, their records were so frequently imitated that they became an important part of the doo-wop legacy through the 1960s.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Sin City Sinners is a group of prominent musicians who perform self-penned originals and rock and roll covers at key venues throughout Las Vegas, Nevada. The band is composed of a tight-knit group of core members: Brent Muscat (ex-Faster Pussycat), guitar; Todd Kerns (Age of Electric, Static in Stereo, Slash), lead vocals and guitar; and Rob Cournoyer (Raging Slab), drums. In addition, Sin City Sinners' performances regularly feature appearances by many notable musicians, comedians, actors, and other entertainers. The group started around 2007, and was spun off from an earlier "Sin City All-Stars" band that featured Brent Muscat and Louie Merlino, amongst others. In 2009 The Sin City Sinners decided to finally put some of their originals and favorites into their debut CD. The CD "Exile on Fremont Street" was produced by frontman Todd Kerns and released in early 2010. The album was met with rave reviews. The hard work of the Sin City Sinners also garnished them the title of "Best In Vegas - Editor's Pick" by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. In mid-2010, Todd Kerns was offered the "opportunity of a lifetime" for any guitar player; to go on tour with Slash. Todd joined Slash on his solo album promotion tours and continues to front the Sin City Sinners when in Las Vegas. While Todd was on tour, the Sinners continued on with help from Louie Merlino (Beggars &amp; Thieves) Jimmy Crespo (Aerosmith) and Scott Griffin (LA Guns) On December 17, 2010 The Sin City Sinners released the all acoustic album titled "Broken Record"On November 25, 2011 the band released the holiday CD "A Sinners Christmas" produced by Brent Muscat &amp; Tom Parham and executive produced by Jason Green. "A Sinners Christmas" included guest appearances by George Lynch, Ron Keel, Slim Jim Phantom (The Stray Cats) Jizzy Pearl (RATT,Love/Hate) Pete Loran (Trixter) Louie Merlino (Beggars &amp; Thieves) Frank Dimino (Angel) &amp; Sammy Serious (The Zeros) In early 2012, long-time bassist Michael "Doc" Ellis left the band, and was replaced by Zach Throne, who has appeared in a number of movies and television shows, and has done music for such as well. In 2013, Michael Ellis returned to play bass and sing, with Zach Throne taking the front man spot while Todd Kerns was on tour with Slash. In July 2014, Zach Throne left the band and with Todd Kerns out on tour again with Slash, they recruited Joshua Alan to take the frontman position.In September 2014, Scott Griffin (formerly of L.A. Guns) was added to the group as bass player.</ns4:description>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shirley_Gunter">
    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Shirley M. Gunter (September 29, 1934 – December 1, 2015) was an American singer and songwriter who led one of the earliest female doo-wop groups, Shirley Gunter and the Queens, in the mid-1950s. She was born in Coffeyville, Kansas; her younger brother was Cornell Gunter. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1942. Cornell Gunter was the first family member to join a vocal group, firstly being a founding member of The Platters and then, in 1953, joining The Flairs. He persuaded the Bihari brothers, owners of Flair Records, to audition his sister Shirley, and they signed her on the spot. After releasing solo singles without success, she formed a group, the Four Queens, with her friends Blondene Taylor and Lula Bee Kenney, and Lula's aunt Lula Mae Suggs. In 1954, Gunter and Taylor worked up a nonsense song, "Oop Shoop", and the group quickly recorded it with saxophonist and arranger Maxwell Davis. Credited to Shirley Gunter and the Queens, it immediately became a regional hit, and rose to number 8 on the national Billboard R&amp;B chart after being promoted by leading DJ Alan Freed. The song was also covered by the Crew-Cuts, whose version made number 13 on the national pop chart, and Harry James recorded a version in 1955 on his album Jukebox Jamboree (Columbia CL 615). "Oop Shoop" became the first record to be written and performed, with any degree of success, by a group of young black women", and inspired later groups such as the Cookies and the Shirelles. The Queens recorded several more singles for Flair, and toured widely. However, their records had little commercial success, and the group split up in late 1955. Gunter toured as a solo performer with Young Jessie and the Flairs, and featured on an early Modern Records compilation LP, The Hollywood Rock &amp; Roll Record Hop. She then became a member of the Flairs, and recorded a moderately successful single, "Headin' Home", with them. In 1958, Shirley Gunter – who had been registered as legally blind by 1954, and later lost her sight completely – left the music business to marry and raise a family. Her only later recordings came in 1965, when she recorded several tracks including the single "Stuck Up", for Ray Charles' Tangerine record label. Shirley Gunter later lived in Las Vegas, and continued to sing at her local church. In 1990, she made a rare appearance with Blondene Taylor, and the Flairs, at a Doo-Wop Society show. She died in Las Vegas in 2015, aged 81. In the 2000s, Ace Records released a CD compilation of her recordings, Oop Shoop: The Flair And Modern Recordings 1953-1957.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Panic! at the Disco is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 and featuring the current lineup of vocalist Brendon Urie, accompanied on tour by bassist Dallon Weekes, guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich. Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the lead single, "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", the album was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. Influenced by 1960s rock bands the Beatles, the Zombies and the Beach Boys, and preceded by the hit single, "Nine in the Afternoon", the band's second studio album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut, and ultimately led to the departure of guitarist and principal songwriter Ryan Ross and bassist Jon Walker, who favored the band's new direction. The duo subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco. Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, "New Perspective", and recruited Dallon Weekes as the group's bassist and Ian Crawford as the band's lead guitarist to accompany the band during live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010, nearing the end of the recording of the band's third studio album, Vices &amp; Virtues (2011). The album was recorded solely by Urie and Smith, with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker. As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with the band since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, leaving Brendon Urie as the only member of the official lineup. In April 2015, "Hallelujah" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016).</ns4:description>

Harry Haag James (March 15, 1916 – July 5, 1983) was an American musician who is best known as a trumpet playing band leader who led a big band from 1939 to 1946. He broke up his band for a short period in 1947 but shortly after he re-organized and was active again with his band from then until his death in 1983. He was especially known among musicians for his astonishing technical proficiency as well as his superior tone, and was extremely influential on up and coming trumpet players from the late 1930s into the 1940s. He was also an actor in a number of motion pictures that usually featured his bands in some way.</ns4:description>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Higher">
    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">The Higher were an American pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada. They were originally known as "September Star". They have released two full-length albums named On Fire, Histrionics and EPs named "Pace Yourself" and "Star is Dead." Their music video for "Insurance?" from On Fire has received moderate rotation on college-oriented video programming, such as MTVu. The video was shot in Las Vegas and features the band performing and playing casino games with dancers. They signed with Epitaph Records and began making pop records, including a cover of Ne-Yo's "Closer". Some believe that since then, they have lost their older punk sound heard on Histrionics and Star is Dead. In 2002, performing under their previous name September Star, The Higher defeated other local bands including Januarys Last Call, Local 15, Absent Minded, Jr. Anti Sex League, and Halfway to win video recording time with VH1 in the first annual Las Vegas Bike Rack Battles. They frequently performed at local venues like the Huntridge and Smoothie King. In February 2008, the band announced that founding member Tom Oakes had left the band. Official band statement: "The Higher regrets to inform everyone that due to personal and creative issues, Tom Oakes has decided to take leave from the band. We wish him the best in his future projects. The Higher will continue on and will perform at all dates posted. The Higher wishes to thank all their fans for their understanding, support and love during this time and hopes to see you on tour." Tom Oakes: "To all of you, I want to thank all of you for what you have done for this band. I am personally shaken about this, but not destroyed. The band is very adamant about continuing on and I have nothing but the most faith in the world that they will not only continue, but succeed.

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Ruth Brown (January 12, 1928 – November 17, 2006) was an American singer-songwriter and actress, sometimes known as the "Queen of R&amp;B". She was noted for bringing a pop music style to R&amp;B music in a series of hit songs for Atlantic Records in the 1950s, such as "So Long", "Teardrops from My Eyes" and "(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean". For these contributions, Atlantic became known as "The house that Ruth built" (alluding to the popular nickname for Old Yankee Stadium). Following a resurgence that began in the mid-1970s and peaked in the 1980s, Brown used her influence to press for musicians' rights regarding royalties and contracts, which led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Her performances in the Broadway musical Black and Blue earned Brown a Tony Award, and the original cast recording won a Grammy Award.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Russell Donald Freeman (May 28, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois – June 27, 2002 in Las Vegas, Nevada) was a bebop and cool jazz pianist and composer. Initially, Freeman was classically trained. His reputation as a jazz pianist grew in the 1940s after working with Art Pepper and Shorty Rogers. Numerous collaborations followed in the 1950s with Chet Baker and Shelly Manne. In 1957 he collaborated with André Previn on the album Double Play!, where they both played piano, accompanied only by Manne on drums. In 1988, Keith Jarrett performed a beautiful version of Freeman's "The Wind" in a solo concert in Paris, which is featured on his album Paris Concert. In 1991, Mariah Carey wrote her own lyrics to "The Wind" for her album Emotions. Freeman had written "The Wind" with original lyrics by Jerry Gladstone; it had been performed as an instrumental piece during the 1950s and 1960s by the likes of Baker, Leo Wright, and Stan Getz, and had been sung by vocalist June Christy (on The Misty Miss Christy). Freeman's piano is featured on Baker's 1954 recording of "The Wind" (featured on Chet Baker with Strings). Freeman remained busy in music throughout his life, transitioning from jazz pianist to film scoring and composition before his death in Las Vegas in 2002. Freeman was married three times, and he had one daughter, Paula Kenley Freeman, from his second marriage. He had no grandchildren.His daughter moved from Seattle to live in the Netherlands in 2009, and an interview about her relationship with her father appeared in the May 2009 issue of the European magazine, PianoWereld.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Five Finger Death Punch, often shortened to Death Punch and abbreviated as 5FDP or FFDP, is an American heavy metal band from Las Vegas, Nevada. Formed in 2005, the band's name is derived from a fictional martial arts maneuver in the 2003 film Kill Bill. The band originally consisted of vocalist Ivan Moody, guitarist Zoltan Bathory, guitarist Caleb Andrew Bingham, bassist Matt Snell, and drummer Jeremy Spencer. Bingham was replaced by guitarist Darrell Roberts in 2006, who was then replaced by Jason Hook in 2009. Bassist Matt Snell departed from the band in 2010, and was replaced by Chris Kael in 2011. Five Finger Death Punch's debut album The Way of the Fist was released in 2007, following which the band began achieving rapid success. The 2009 follow-up album War Is the Answer further increased their popularity, leading to both of the albums being certified gold by the RIAA, selling at least 500,000 copies each in the United States. The band's third album, American Capitalist, was released on October 11, 2011 and achieved Gold status within the year. The band has played international music festivals including Mayhem Festival in 2008, 2010 and 2013, and Download Festival in 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2015. Five Finger Death Punch are the recipients of the Radio Contraband Rock Radio Awards for "Indie Artist of the Year" in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. They were also honored with the Radio Contraband Rock Radio Award for Album (American Capitalist) and Song of the Year ("Coming Down") in 2012 and "Video of the Year" for "Wrong Side of Heaven" in 2014.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Slaughter is an American hard rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada by lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum. The band reached stardom in 1990 with their first album Stick It to Ya, which spawned several hit singles including "Up All Night", "Spend My Life", "Mad About You" and "Fly to the Angels". The album reached double platinum status in the United States. The band remains a steady act in national tours, mainly in the Rock Never Stops Tour which features several bands of the same era. Slaughter formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in late-1988, out of the ashes of lead vocalist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum's previous band, Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Vinnie Vincent Invasion's record company, Chrysalis Records, took the $4 million contract away from Vinnie Vincent for overexceeding his credit line with the label, and transferred the contract to former members Slaughter and Strum. By 1989, Slaughter and Strum completed the lineup by recruiting lead guitarist Tim Kelly and drummer Blas Elias.</ns4:description>

Since its formation, the band has acquired members Melissa Marth (keyboards and younger sister to Ryan), Jeff Ford (bass, guitars), Timothy Styles (bass), and newest member Brandon Johnson (drums). The band has three official albums that include performances by the entire band, and one album recorded and released solely by band creator Ryan Marth. Ryan and Melissa Marth's middle sibling Tommy Marth also performed saxophone on the band's albums. Tommy was best known for his role as saxophonist for The Killers. In September 2013, the band performed their final show with bassist Tim Styles, who after 5 years with Big Friendly announced he’d be leaving to focus on his family and his other band, Skorchamenza. The show was held at the Dillinger in Boulder City, Nevada. Big Friendly closed out the show with a solo performance by Styles who sang a cover version of Ty Segall's Goodbye Bread. Soon after, the band told Las Vegas Weekly's Leslie Ventura that they would be returning to their roots as a foursome, with guitarist Jeff Ford reprising his role as bass player.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Robert Lee "Bob" Flanigan (August 22, 1926 – May 15, 2011) was an American tenor vocalist and founding member of The Four Freshmen, a jazz vocal group. The Four Freshmen originated in early 1948 when brothers Ross and Don Barbour, then at Butler University's Arthur Jordan Conservatory in Indianapolis, Indiana, formed a barbershop quartet called Hal's Harmonizers. Flanigan was a cousin of the Barbours and joined The Harmonizers beginning on September 20, 1948, becoming their lead vocalist. He also played trombone and double bass. In 1950, The Four Freshmen got a break when band leader Stan Kenton heard the quartet in Dayton, Ohio, and arranged for an audition with his label, Capitol Records, which signed The Four later that year. In 1952, they released their first hit single "It's a Blue World". Further hits included "Mood Indigo" in 1954, "Day by Day" in 1955, and "Graduation Day" in 1956. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, The Four Freshmen released a number of recordings, made film and television appearances, and performed in concert. The group eventually lost their mainstream following with the advent of the British pop bands of the 1960s. The group continued to perform under the management of Flanigan, who maintained rights to The Four Freshmen name and was responsible for the group's changing cast of performers. Flanigan retired as a performer in 1992, but continued his involvement with the group for several more years. He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Las Vegas, on May 15, 2011, aged 84.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Tommie Lee Guthrie (December 27, 1937 - June 14, 2013), known professionally as Tom Tall, was an American rockabilly singer popular in the 1950s. He was born in Amarillo, Texas and discovered at a talent show by record label owner Fabor Robison. He often sang duets with Ginny Wright, and later recorded for Crest and Decca Records where he met Eddie Cochran, a session musician for the label. In the 1960s, he was on the Chart label and had a comeback hit with Wright. While he was with Chart, Tall made a series of singles including a song called "Walk Tall" which was tailor-made because of his professional name. It was picked up in the United Kingdom by Irish singer Val Doonican, who made the top five with the song. Tall retired in Los Angeles, where he was rediscovered by the German label Bear Family Records, which issued albums in the 1980s by Tall and Wright. A recent CD by Bear Family was shared equally between both artists. Tom Tall died on June 14, 2013 at age 75 in Las Vegas, Nevada.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">Modern Science is an alternative pop band from Las Vegas, Nevada founded by Kane Churko &amp; Mike McHugh with funk, electro, hiphop and R&amp;B influences. Canadian songwriter/producer Kane Churko is the front man and lead singer for the band and primary writer and producer of all of Modern Science's music. Kane is the son of producer Kevin Churko who is also a frequent co-producer of the band's material. Kevin Churko is also known to play drums on occasion for Modern Science at their rare live shows as well as on most of their recorded material. The band is known for their improvisational live shows that often include special guests from other entertainers that they work with. In January 2010 while opening two nights at the Hard Rock cafe for Simon Collins the band announced that they would release one free song every month leading up to their second album and that it would feature a lot more hip hop elements as well as collaborators such as Del The Funky Homosapien and Reallionaire Jream. This follows in line with their history of releasing their self-titled debut album on their own independent record label MIMORTL Records for free online as well. The pair put on a critically acclaimed performance at CMJ Music Marathon 2010 in October 2009 in New York City along with frequent live band members Charles Henry, Michael Spadoni, Nick Helbling &amp; Kevin Churko. Kane Churko and Mike McHugh are currently listed as celebrity judges for national Battle Of The Band's contest "A Fight For Fame".</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">King Diamond is a Danish heavy metal band formed in 1985 by vocalist King Diamond, guitarists Andy LaRocque and Michael Denner, bassist Timi Hansen and drummer Mikkey Dee. Diamond, Denner and Hansen had recently departed the group Mercyful Fate, and decided to form a new band under the King Diamond moniker, as it was already known from the Mercyful Fate days. In 1986, King Diamond released their debut album Fatal Portrait. Since then the band have released a total of twelve studio albums (most of them concept albums), two live albums, two extended plays, five compilations and five singles. Since the band's inception, there have been over fifteen musicians in and out of King Diamond, with the only two mainstays being vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Andy LaRocque. In 1987 the band released their second studio release Abigail (their first concept album). Throughout the 1980s, King Diamond released a total of four studio albums. In the early 1990s, the band was put on hold when King Diamond reunited with his former outfit Mercyful Fate. After reforming King Diamond in 1994, Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 90's. Since the early 2000s, King Diamond have kept recording and touring and, since 2014, the band has been composed of vocalist King Diamond, guitarist Andy LaRocque, guitarist Mike Wead, drummer Matt Thompson, and bassist Pontus Egberg.</ns4:description>

    <ns4:description xml:lang="en">The Audibles is a Pop Music, hip hop production duo from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of  Dominic "DJ Mecca" Jordan and Jimmy "Jimmy G" Giannos. The 2x Grammy nominated duo, Dominic “DJ MECCA” Jordan and Jimmy “Jimmy G” Giannos, met in 2007 at the “Lost in Love” music video shoot for Polow Da Don artists I-15 at the Palms Casino in Paradise, Nevada. Jimmy was interested in working with JR Castro from I-15 for one of his artist songs. They officially met up a week later at Odds On Recording Studios in Henderson. After vibing at the studio in an all night session, they realized each other talents and began to create together. They coined their name “The Audibles” from its root definition “to be heard” and “to change the game” as seen by quarterbacks in football. JR Castro and Das offered an opportunity for the two to move to Atlanta and develop their art further under producer Polow Da Don.</ns4:description>
